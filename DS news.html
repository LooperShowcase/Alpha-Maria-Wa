    <h1>season 2</h1>
    <h2>episode 1</h2>
    <h3>The bulk of the episode deals with Uzui’s ludicrous plan to gather information in the district, dressing Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke up as girls so they can infiltrate three different brothels in search of Uzui’s wives. Of course, things don’t quite go as planned and Uzui has to get creative to get people to take each of the trio. 

        This episode is the perfect example of how an anime can take the source material and really add something to it simply through the act of animation. The Entertainment District is absolutely gorgeous, and its vibrant neon colors are a drastic change in aesthetic from what the show has had so far.
        
        There are two specific scenes that also really shine in this episode, with the first being Tanjiro’s inability to lie without making the most absurd face you’ve ever seen. The second is Zenitsu going absolutely ballistic on a shamisen, trying to make up for his “ugliness” as a girl. It’s almost impossible to describe just how well these scenes play, and there were multiple moments I found myself laughing out loud. 
        
        Anyone hoping Season 2 of Demon Slayer would jump right into the action is going to be a bit disappointed, but in this case, I think the build-up will be worth it. Having the first few episodes be much more light-hearted and comical provides a good breather after the emotionally harrowing Mugen Train. There’s a briskness to the tone and pacing of the second season so far, and I sincerely hope Demon Slayer can keep that up moving forward. </h3>
        <h2>episode 2</h2>
    <h3>Demon Slayer’s second season feels like it is kicking off proper, as the second episode features Tanjiro’s group and Tengen Uzui infiltrating the Entertainment District. It’s still going to be a bit before the action starts, but episode two manages to absolutely nail the humor of the series. 

        It’s here we start to learn a bit more about the Sound Hashira Uzui, including the fact that he has three wives. Zenitsu, right off the bat, can’t stand Uzui due to his womanizing ways. Just like the manga, the show uses this to great effect to create comedy. </h3>
